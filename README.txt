## Gabriela Oyarzun Batlle's Portfolio

### Overview
This portfolio website showcases my work as an engineer, designer, and artist. The site features projects across several fields of design, including engineering design, graphic design, UI/UX design, and human-centered design. The website is designed to be accessible, responsive, and interactive, offering an engaging user experience across different devices and browsers.

### Interactive Features

#### 1. Dark Mode Toggle
- **Description**: This feature allows users to switch between light and dark mode.
- **Behavior**: 
  - Users can click the "Toggle Dark Mode" button in the header to switch the website's theme from light to dark mode and vice versa.
- **Implementation**: The dark mode is implemented using a JavaScript function `toggleDarkMode()` that toggles the `dark-mode` class on the `body` element. On the other hand, CSS rules adjust the background colors, text colors, and other styles to match the dark theme.

#### 2. Smooth Scrolling Navigation
- **Description**: This feature provides smooth scrolling when navigating between different sections of the website.
- **Behavior**: 
  - When users click on a navigation link or a button that jumps to a specific section, the page scrolls smoothly to the section the user clicked on.
- **Implementation**: Smooth scrolling is implemented with `scroll-behavior: smooth;` on CSS.

### Accessibility
The portfolio is designed with accessibility in mind, ensuring that all users, including those with disabilities, can access the content and navigate the site easily. This is due to:

- **Keyboard Navigation**: All interactive elements, including buttons and links, are fully navigable using the keyboard. Focus states are clearly defined to indicate the selected element by the user.
- **Screen Reader Compatibility**: The site uses semantic HTML elements, such as `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>` so it can be easily interpreted by screen readers.
- **Contrast and Visibility**: The site employs high-contrast colors for text and background, particularly in dark mode, to ensure readability.
- **Responsive Design**: The site is fully responsive, adapting to various screen sizes from large desktops to mobile devices, which ensures a consistent user experience across all platforms.
- **Accessible Fonts**: The website uses easily readable fonts and has sufficient spacing between elements, which ensures that the text is legible for all users.

### Additional Features
- **Consistent Image Sizing (Except Graphic Design)**: Images in project sections, except for the graphic design section, are resized and aligned to ensure a coherent design. This enhances the visual consistency across the site.
- **Logical Headings**: Headings are used in a logical order with no skipped heading levels, which gives a clear and accessible structure for both users and assistive technologies.
- **No Keyboard Traps**: The site is free from keyboard traps, allowing users to navigate smoothly without getting stuck in any interactive elements.

### Testing
The portfolio has been tested on multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) and devices (desktop, tablet, mobile) to ensure compatibility, responsiveness, and usability.

### Conclusion
My portfolio website is a comprehensive showcase of my work, featuring interactive and accessible design elements that provide an engaging user experience. The site is responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across devices, and includes features that enhance usability while adhering to accessibility guidelines.
